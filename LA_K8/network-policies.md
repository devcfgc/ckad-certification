In order to use NetworkPolicies in the cluster, we need to have a network plugin that supports them. We can accomplish this alongside an existing flannel setup using canal:
```
wget -O canal.yaml https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.5/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/canal/canal.yaml

kubectl apply -f canal.yaml
```

Create a sample nginx pod:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: network-policy-secure-pod
  labels:
    app: secure-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Create a client pod which can be used to test network access to the Nginx pod:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: network-policy-client-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]
```

Use this command to get the cluster IP address of the Nginx pod:
`kubectl get pod network-policy-secure-pod -o wide`

Use the secure pod's IP address to test network access from the client pod to the secure Nginx pod:
`kubectl exec network-policy-client-pod -- curl <secure pod cluster ip address>`

Create a network policy that restricts all access to the secure pod, except to and from pods which bear the allow-access: "true" label:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          allow-access: "true"
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          allow-access: "true"
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

Get information about NetworkPolicies in the cluster:
```
kubectl get networkpolicies
kubectl describe networkpolicy my-network-policy
```
