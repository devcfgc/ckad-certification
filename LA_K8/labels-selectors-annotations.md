Here is a pod with some labels.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-production-label-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
    environment: production
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

```

You can view existing labels with kubectl describe. `kubectl describe pod my-production-label-pod`

Here is another pod with different labels.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-development-label-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
    environment: development
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

You can use various selectors to select different subsets of objects.
```
kubectl get pods -l app=my-app

kubectl get pods -l environment=production

kubectl get pods -l environment=development

kubectl get pods -l environment!=production

kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (development,production)'

kubectl get pods -l app=my-app,environment=production
```

Here is a simple pod with some annotations.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-annotation-pod
  annotations:
    owner: terry@linuxacademy.com
    git-commit: bdab0c6
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

Like labels, existing annotations can also be viewed using kubectl describe. `kubectl describe pod my-annotation-pod`
